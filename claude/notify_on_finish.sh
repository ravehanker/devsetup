# install it by adding the following to your ~/.claude/settings.json or similar;
# this can also be done by using the "claude-based helper" /hooks command
#
# ```json
# {

# Read the JSON data passed from Claude Code
INPUT=$(cat)

# if you want to see what the json actually looks like, uncomment the following
# this can be used for example to tune the MESSAGE you want to send
# echo "$INPUT" > ~/.claude/json_out.json

# get the MESSAGE to print in the notification
# a message that says which prompt just returned; the description is an AI summary of the prompt
MESSAGE=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r ".tool_input.description")

# Send the notification
notify-send "ClaudeCode prompt finished" "$MESSAGE" --icon=terminal
